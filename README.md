# Translator app

This project is a translator. It allows users to upload an Excel file, select sheets and columns to translate, and specify target languages for translation. The translations are performed using OpenAI's GPT models.
The model is configurable. It can run in parallel to speed up and the number of processors to run is configurable. You can set these parameters in `params.yaml` file.
